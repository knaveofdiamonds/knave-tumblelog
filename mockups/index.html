	<blockquote class="long">Programming in Scheme is like driving on an open freeway versus commuting in gridlocked traffic. You can concentrate on the destination versus trying to not get killed getting there [&#8230;] But, on the dark side, Scheme is a beautiful singing siren, resting on the white sand of a remote harbor that is deceptively shallow and bottomed with jagged rocks. She sits waiting for programmers who may have lost their way and find themselves out and about, searching for Something Else. They see the beauty of Scheme, hear its song, and turn their ships toward the white, sandy beaches that frame Her, only to have their hopes crushed against the hidden limitations by the pounding surf of &#8220;Commercial Deliverability, Corporate Confidence, and Business Realities&#8221;.</blockquote>

        <h1>Sliced sign up</h1>
        <p><a title="The merb slices screencast over at merbunity" href="http://merbunity.com/screencasts/1">Merb slices</a> have landed, hopefully bringing a <a title="It just uses the public apis you know." href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/22/the-greatest-thing-since-sliced-merb/">cleaner version</a> of <a href="http://rails-engines.org/">rails engines</a> to the <a href="http://merbivore.com">other ruby framework</a>. Still only on edge/0.9.4 merb for now.</p>
        <p>Authentication is an obvious target for slices, and there are several implementations - <a href="http://downtowncartel.com/can-has-auth-sure/">can_has_auth</a> which I failed to get working (merb moves so quickly that things break) and <a href="http://merbunity.com/tutorials/13">merb-auth</a>, amongst others. The problem is that like most authentication plugins/extensions/whatevers, there is little flexibility in the workflow of the sign up process, and that default workflow isn&#8217;t necessarily the best.</p>
        <p>I wish more apps followed the model used by <a title="A little picture of you, yes you." href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> and <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>, where you just have to give an email address to sign up: adding a password, username or whatever other account details are needed is wrapped up in the &#8216;post-email-address-validation&#8217; stage.</p>
        <p>This works especially well if you&#8217;ve made the decision to <a title="Sign up forms must die" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/signupforms">allow people to use your application before registering</a> - the registration step becomes a &#8220;I need to save my stuff&#8221; rather than a &#8220;I want to try this out&#8221; goal. With this mindset a user is going to get more frustrated by barriers - they can&#8217;t just walk away.</p>
        <p>Looking at the examples, creating slices doesn&#8217;t seem particularly tricky, so packaging another authentication workflow is possible. The problem is that everyone is going to want a slightly different way of doing things, and then a hundred authentication slices are born.</p>
        <p>The real value might just come from being able to reuse slices in your own projects, rather than <a title="David's argument against components" href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000407.html">feeling you have to pick up something generic and tweak it</a> - keep them open so others can learn from them and get reuse for yourself.</p>
